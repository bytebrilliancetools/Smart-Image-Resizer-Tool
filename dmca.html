                <h1>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Policy</h1>
                
                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 9, 2025</p>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 9, 2025</p>

                <p>SmartImageResizer ("we," "us," or "our") respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. This DMCA Policy outlines our procedures for addressing copyright infringement claims in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (17 U.S.C. § 512).</p>

                <h2>1. Overview</h2>

                <p>SmartImageResizer provides a client-side image resizing tool that processes images entirely within users' web browsers. We do not host, store, or have access to user images. However, we take copyright infringement seriously and will respond appropriately to valid notices of alleged copyright infringement.</p>

                <h2>2. Important Notice About Our Service</h2>

                <h3>2.1 Client-Side Processing</h3>
                <p>Our image resizing tool operates using client-side technology, which means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All image processing occurs locally in the user's web browser</li>
                    <li>Images are never uploaded to our servers</li>
                    <li>We do not store, cache, or have access to any user images</li>
                    <li>We cannot monitor what images users process</li>
                    <li>We cannot remove or block specific images from being processed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 User Responsibility</h3>
                <p>Users are solely responsible for ensuring they have the legal right to upload, modify, and use any images processed through our service. By using our service, users represent and warrant that they own or have obtained all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions for the images they process.</p>

                <h2>3. Scope of DMCA Compliance</h2>

                <p>Given the nature of our service, DMCA takedown requests may apply to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content we host on our website (text, graphics, logos, etc.)</li>
                    <li>User-generated content we may host (such as contact form submissions, if published)</li>
                    <li>Any cached or stored content on our servers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>DMCA takedown requests <strong>cannot</strong> apply to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Images processed by users through our client-side tool (as we have no access to them)</li>
                    <li>Content that exists solely on user devices</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Filing a DMCA Takedown Notice</h2>

                <h3>6.2 Requirements for Valid Counter-Notice</h3>
                <p>A valid counter-notification must include:</p>

                <h2>7. Repeat Infringer Policy</h2>

                <p>In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also, at our sole discretion, limit access to our website and/or terminate accounts of any users who infringe intellectual property rights, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

                <h2>8. False Claims</h2>

                <h3>8.1 Penalties for Misrepresentation</h3>
                <p>Under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Material or activity is infringing, or</li>
                    <li>Material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification</li>
                </ul>
                <p>shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer or the service provider who is injured by such misrepresentation.</p>

                <h3>8.2 Good Faith Requirement</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to seek damages from any party who submits a DMCA notification or counter-notification in bad faith or with knowledge of material misrepresentation.</p>

                <h2>9. Limitations and Exceptions</h2>

                <h3>9.1 Fair Use</h3>
                <p>We respect the doctrine of fair use and other exceptions to copyright law. Before submitting a DMCA notice, please consider whether the use of copyrighted material may qualify as fair use.</p>

                <h3>9.2 Safe Harbor</h3>
                <p>Given that our image processing service is entirely client-side and we do not host user images, we believe we qualify for safe harbor protections under the DMCA. However, we will still respond appropriately to valid notices regarding content we do host.</p>

                <h2>10. Non-U.S. Copyright Issues</h2>

                <p>The DMCA is a United States copyright law. If you believe your copyright has been infringed and you are located outside the United States, you may still contact us at the address above. We will review complaints under applicable international copyright laws and treaties.</p>

                <h2>11. Other Intellectual Property Concerns</h2>
